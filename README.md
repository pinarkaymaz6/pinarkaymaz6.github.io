## Template
The template used in my blog is forked from [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)

Minimal Mistakes is a flexible two-column Jekyll theme. Perfect for hosting your personal site, blog, or portfolio on GitHub or self-hosting on your own server. As the name implies --- styling is purposely minimalistic to be enhanced and customized by you :smile:.
