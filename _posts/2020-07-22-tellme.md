Servus! I created an anonymous Question-Answer platform where people can ask a question or submit their own answers or advices using _Django_. Although I am fan of _Flask_ for creating HTTP services that renders templates, for more complex and larger web applications Django provides _Model-View-Controller_ framework and _data models_. I will share my steps to create a simple web application with _Django_. You can find the completed project on my [GitHub](https://github.com/pinarkaymaz6/tellme) profile.

### 1. Create a Django project and an application
  - Create a root folder for the project, e.g. called `tellme`
  ```shell
  mkdir tellme
  ```
  - Create a file called `requirements.txt` which keeps the Python dependency list in the root directory. Add _Django_ to the file.
  ```shell
  cd tellme
  touch requirements.txt
  echo "Django==3.0.8" >> requirements.txt
  ```
  - Create a virtual environment
  ```shell
  python3 -m venv env
  source env/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  Now that the virtual environment is activated, I can refer to `Python 3` by only `python` from now on. 
  - Create the initial structure of a _Django_ project
  ```shell
  django-admin startproject webapp
  cd webbapp
  python manage.py startapp tellme
  ```
  - Start the application
  ```shell
  python manage.py runserver
  ```
  There are couple of things going on here when you first run this command. Firstly, this created `db.sqlite3` file which is the local database for the project. Also, we see this message below in the output:  
  ```You have 17 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app(s): admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions. Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.```  
  For now, this is normal. Now check your application at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/tellme/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/tellme/) which serves a default page.

### 2. Create models and populate the database
Now we can take care of the message before. 
  - Go to `models.py` and create two models `Question` and `Answer`.  

    ```python
    class Question(models.Model):
      q_title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
      q_text = models.CharField(max_length=300)
      q_date = models.DateTimeField('Date published')

    class Answer(models.Model):
      a_text = models.CharField(max_length=300)
      a_date = models.DateTimeField('Date published')
      a_votes = models.IntegerField(default=0)
      question = models.ForeignKey(Question, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    ```
  - Now stop the app if you haven't (`CTRL + C`) and "make migrations" which creates new migrations based on the changes you made to your models.  
  ```shell
  python manage.py makemigrations tellme
  ```
  It says `No installed app with label 'tellme'`. This is because you have to add the app in _INSTALLED\_APPS_
  - Go to `webapp/settings.py` and add `tellme` in _INSTALLED\_APPS_ and run the command above again.
  - Run the "migrate" command which creates `tellme/migrations` folder.
  ```shell
  python manage.py migrate
  ```
  - Now we can populate the database. Open the _Django_ shell.
  ```shell
  python manage.py shell
  ```
  - Add a question
  ```console
  import django
  from tellme.models import Question, Answer
  from django.utils import timezone
  django.setup()
  q= Question(q_title = "Best gift for a gamer?",q_text="I am looking for cool gift ideas for my fiance who likes video games.", q_date=timezone.now())
  q.save()
  Question.objects.all()
  ```

  This should print `<QuerySet [<Question: Question object (1)>]>`. You can add a `__str__` method to the models which will help you print more details. Just remember to quit the _Django_ shell (`exit()`) and start again after you make changes to the models.

  - While still inside the _Django_ shell, create answers for our question.
  ```console
  q=Question.objects.get(pk=1)
  q.choice_set.create(a_text = "You can buy a full desk mousepad",a_date=timezone.now(), a_votes=0)
  q.save()
  exit()
  ```

### 3. Admin Tool
  - In order to acces admin tool, we need to set up login.
  ```shell
  python manage.py createsuperuser
  ``` 
  It ask for your login information. Enter your username, email address and password. 
  - Now start the app again (`python manage.py runserver`). Go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin). It shows Users and Groups. But we want to see Questions and Answers. 
  ![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/tellme/admin_ug.png)
  - Go to `admin.py` and register `Question` and `Answer` models.  

    ```python
    from django.contrib import admin
    from .models import Question, Answer

    admin.site.register(Question)
    admin.site.register(Answer)
    ```
  - Now check [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin) again. 
  
    ![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/tellme/admin_qa.png) 

  - Click on `Questions` and it shows the question we added. Then click on `ADD QUESTION` to add new questions.
  - Now come back to the admin page and navigate to `Answers` to add new answers. When you add a new answer, you should link it to the question that you are answering. 

### 4. URLs
Now it's time to set up the URLs that shows some content.
  - Go to `webapp/urls.py` and add `tellme/` path similar to `admin` path.
    ```python
    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import path, include

    urlpatterns = [
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
        path('tellme/', include(('tellme.urls', 'tellme'), namespace="tellme")),
    ]
    ```
  - Now create another `urls.py` but under `tellme/` directory. Here we define all the paths for the application. The `index` path serves the home page which lists the questions. When you click on one of the questions, it shows the detail view of the question with associated answers. The other two paths are to add question and answers. The important thing is when our app receives a request on these paths, it goes to associated functions in `views.py` to create a response.   
    ```python
    from django.urls import path
    from . import views  

    urlpatterns = [
        path('', views.index, name="index"),  #127.0.0.1:8080/tellme
        path('<int:question_id>/', views.detail, name="detail"), #127.0.0.1:8080/tellme/2
        path('<int:question_id>/add_answer', views.add_answer, name="add_answer"),
        path('add_question', views.add_question, name="add_question"),
    ]
    ```
### 5. Views
We created paths, now we should add functions to `views.py` to create responses for each of the paths. 
  - Add a function called `index` which renders the home page. First, retrieve the latest 5 questions from the database and pass these as a `context` to `render` function with the `index.html`. For now, ignore the html pages. 
    ```python
    def index(request):
      latest_questions = Question.objects.order_by('q_date')[:5]
      context = {'latest_questions':latest_questions}
      return render(request, 'tellme/index.html', context)
    ```
  - Add a function called `detail` which will show the detailed view of the questions with answers. This function receives ID of the question clicked on and creates a response with the question selected and its answers.
    ```python
    def detail(request, question_id):
      question = get_object_or_404(Question, pk=question_id)
      context = {"question":question}
      return render(request, 'tellme/detail.html', context)
    ```
  - To be to add a new answer to a question, create a function called `add_answer`. This function receives the question ID and parses the answer from the POST request and then adds this answers to the question's answer set. Finally, it redirects to same page. 
    ```python
    def add_answer(request, question_id):
      question = get_object_or_404(Question, pk=question_id)
      try:
          text = request.POST['answer']
          question.answer_set.create(a_text=text, a_date=timezone.now())
          question.save()
      except:
          return render(request, 'tellme/detail.html', {'question': question, 'error_message': 'Please enter some text'})

      return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('tellme:detail', args=(question.id,))) 
    ```
  - Last function is `add_question` which parses title and text of the quetion from the request and add it to the database. This function also redirects to the same page. 
    ```python
    def add_question(request):
      try:
          q_title = request.POST['q_title']
          q_text = request.POST['q_text']
          question = Question(q_title=q_title, q_text=q_text, q_date=timezone.now())
          question.save()
      except:
          return render(request, 'tellme/index.html')

      return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('tellme:index')) 
    ```
### 6. Templates
A Django project can be configured with one or several [template](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/templates/) engines (or even zero if you donâ€™t use templates). Django ships built-in backends for its own template system, creatively called the Django template language (DTL), and for the popular alternative Jinja2. We will use DTL. 
  - Under `tellme/` directory, create a folder called `templates` and then create another folder called `tellme` inside the templates. The reason we use this structure is that becase there can be multiple applications under our webapp and each might have a template called `index/html`. We create a folder under templates for each application. 
  - Create an html file called `base.html` under `templates/tellme` add some default html tags. This base page has some DTL tags as well. DHL tags provide arbitrary logic in the rendering process like if statements or loops. Tags are surrounded by "{ %" and "% }". It also includes some references to static files which will be mentioned shortly.
  
    ```html
    {% raw %}
    {% load static %}
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Tell Me</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% static 'tellme/style.css' %}" />
    </head>
    <body>
        {% block main_content %}
        {% endblock %}
    </body>
    </html>
    {% endraw %}
    ```
  
  - Now create an html file called `index.html` which extends `base.html`. This page uses DTL tags lo iterate and print the latest questions that `index` function in `views.py` sends. It also has a form which allows to submit a new question. When a new question is submitted via form, it send a request to the `add_question` in `views.py`. 
  {% raw %}
    ```html
    {% extends 'tellme/base.html' %} 
    {% block main_content %} 
        {% if latest_questions %}
        <ul>
            {% for question in latest_questions %}
            <li><a href={% url "tellme:detail" question.id %}><b>{{question.q_title}}</b></a></li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
        {% else %}
            <p>No questions yet. Please add a few.</p>

        {% endif %}
            <form action="{% url 'tellme:add_question' %}" method="post">
                {% csrf_token %}
                <label for="q_title">Question Title</label>
                <input type="text" id="q_title" name="q_title" placeholder="Enter your title here..." required><br>
                <label for="q_text">Question Details</label>
                <textarea id="q_text" name="q_text" rows="1" cols="30" placeholder="Enter your question here..." required></textarea><br>
                <input type="submit" value="Add" />
            </form>
    {% endblock %}
  ```
  {% endraw %}
  - Create an html page called `detail.html` which also extends the `base.html`. This page prints the questions and the associated answers. It also includes a form which allows to submit a new answer. When an answewr submitted, it sends a request to the `add_answer` function in `views.py`.
  {% raw %}
    ```html
    {% extends 'tellme/base.html' %} 
    {% block main_content %}
    <h1>{{question.q_title}}</h1>
    <p>{{question.q_text}}</p>
    {% if error_message %}
        <p><strong>{{error_message}}</strong></p>
    {% endif %}
    <h4>Advices</h4>
    {% csrf_token %} 
    {% for answer in question.answer_set.all %} 
        <li><b>{{answer.a_text}}</b></li>
    {% endfor %}
        <form action="{% url 'tellme:add_answer' question.id %}" method="post">
            {% csrf_token %}
            
            <textarea id="answer" name="answer" rows="2" cols="30" placeholder="Enter your answer here..."></textarea>
            <input type="submit" value="Add" />
        </form>

    {% endblock %}
    ``` 
  {% endraw %}
### 7. Static Files
Until now, we created a few funtionalities for the application. Now we can add some style. 
  - Create a folder called `static` under `tellme` directory. Inside the `static` folder, create another folder called `tellme`. This is useful again if you have multiple apps. 
  - Create a css file called `style.css` and add some styles for the list tag. You can of course add more styles. 
  ```css
  li a {
    font-size: 20px;
  }
  ```
  - Now check your localhost at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/tellme](). You should be able to view and add questions and answers. 

That's it. I hope this is useful for some of you.
