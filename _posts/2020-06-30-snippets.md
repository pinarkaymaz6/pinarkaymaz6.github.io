I don't know how many times I had to google for commands or code snippets I used before. People use differents methods to tackle this problem. Some people master the command line history search and others keep the most frequently used commands in a file to copy easily. Personally, I find it nice to have my favorite commands or snippets in one place. I want to share some of them here. 

- Create a virtual environment and install dependencies in your project
```shell
python3 -m venv FILENAME
source FILENAME/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Authenticate to `Google Cloud SDK` and set your project
```shell
gcloud auth login     # It redirects to browser, confirm to allow it
gcloud config set project PROJECTID
```

- Deploy your project to Google App Engine via `Google Cloud SDK`. 
```shell
gcloud app deploy app.yaml --project PROJECTID 
```
- Change Git language to English (one time)
```shell
LC_ALL=C git status
```
