I don't know how many times I had to google for commands or code snippets I used before. People use differents methods to tackle this problem. Some people master the command line history search and others keep the most frequently used commands in a file to copy easily. Personally, I find it nice to have my favorite commands or snippets in one place. I want to share some of them here.

## CLI
### General

- Create a virtual environment and install dependencies in your project
  ```shell
  python3 -m venv FILENAME
  source FILENAME/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Cloud
- Authenticate to `Google Cloud SDK` and set your project
  ```shell
  gcloud auth login     # It redirects to browser, confirm to allow it
  gcloud config set project PROJECTID
  ```

- Deploy your project to Google App Engine via `Google Cloud SDK`.  
  ```shell
  gcloud app deploy app.yaml --project PROJECTID 
  ```
- Monitor logs from your GAE app `Google Cloud SDK`.
  ```shell
  gcloud app logs tail -s default
  ```

### Git
- Change Git language to English (one time)
  ```shell
  LC_ALL=C git status
  ```

## Snippets
### Data Science

- Select categorical columns with relatively low cardinality
  ```python
  low_cardinality_cols = [cname for cname in X_train.columns if X_train[cname].nunique() < 10 and 
                          X_train[cname].dtype == "object"]
```
- Select numeric columns    

  ```python
  numeric_cols = [cname for cname in X_train.columns if X_train[cname].dtype in ['int64', 'float64']]
  ```

## Shortcuts
### Jupyter Notebook

- Insert a cell below: `b` (while the cell is blue)
- Delete a selected cell: `dd` (while the cell is blue)
