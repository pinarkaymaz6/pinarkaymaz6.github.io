## What is an Unconference?

Unconference is a participant-driven meeting. Unlike traditional
conferences, unconferences have more engaging and interactive format 
by allowing attendees to set agenda and host their own sessions. 
Goal is to prioritize conversation over presentation.

## How does it work?

The topics and schedule are generated by the attendees on the spot.
Participants can hold many types of sessions where topic could be just about anything – a discussion , a burning question, a lightning talk, a project demo, a rant, a pair-programming session, or whatever.

Usually the event starts out with a welcome session followed by the marketplace.
The marketplace is where the agenda is scheduled. Participants who wants to 
hold a session announces their topics and picks a time slot and a room. Later on
the participants join breakout sessions based on their interest and relevance.
Finally everyone gathers in the main area again to share their 
experiences or what they learnt from the sessions. This completes the unconference.

## Why unconferences make sense?

Budd A, [et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4310607/). explains that typically, the organizing committee decide on 
the main theme, announces Call for Papers to review potential topics and 
the selected speakers share their work through presentations 
in traditional conferences. However, they add that the real value comes from 
interactive discussions.
> "The most stimulating discussions generally take place over 
coffee breaks when attendees can interact with each other and 
discuss various topics, including their own interests, in a more informal manner
while expanding their own professional networks."


### Four principles and One Law  [[1]](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology#Guiding_Principles_and_One_Law), [[2]](https://wind4change.com/open-space-technology-ost-harrison-owen-principles/), [[3]](https://www.echteld.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Open-Space-Technology-whitepaper-LAY-OUT-2.pdf)
Although the unconferences are quite flexible in format, there are simple rules
to encourage participants to get the most out of it.
- _Whoever comes is the right people_: It's not how many people come or even who comes 
  that counts but quality of the interactions and conversations. It's the passion and 
  interest that people share about the topics that makes difference. [link]
- _Whenever it starts is the right time_: It reminds participants that "spirit and 
  creativity do not run on the clock."
- _Whatever happens is the only thing that could have_: It reminds participants that once 
  something has happened, it's done—and no amount of fretting, complaining or otherwise rehashing can change that. Move on. [link]
- _When it’s over, it’s over_: If the discussion feels complete before the session time, 
  move away from it onto something else [link]

If at any time during our time together you find yourself in any situation where you are neither learning nor contributing, use your two feet, go someplace else where you think you'll be more productive.
