# Intro to search algortihms

## What's tree search?

- implementation

## What's graph search?

- implementation

_A solution is an action_ sequence, so search algorithms work by considering various possible action sequences. The possible action sequences starting at the initial state form a search tree with the initial state at the root; the branches are actions and the nodes correspond to states in the state space of the problem.
